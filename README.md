Human Activity Recognition using smartphones
============================================

Study Design
------------

This tidy dataset uses raw data obtained from an experiment conducted on 30 volunteers
by Smart lab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, DITEN - Universit√© degli Studi di Genova, Genoa I-16145, Italy. 

[The original data set may be found here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

From this dataset, we kept only the mean and standard values of the features. We then summarized the data set and kept
only one averaged value for every combination Activity/Subject.

This data processing can be reproduced by running run_analysis.R with the original dataset in your working directory.

#### General remarks

All of the numerical variables have both a mean and a standard deviation column. They have been all normalized and
are thus _unitless_.

The numerical variables are named according to this convention:

    {d}{name}.{mode}[.{axis}]

Explanations for the different components:

- d: the variable starts with a *t* if it is in the temporal domain and with an *f* if it is in the frequency domain
- name: the name of the physical quantity measured by the variable
- mode: either *mean* or *std* for the mean or the standard deviation
- axis: if the quantity is a vector, the axis components will be either *X*, *Y* or *Z*

### Subject

Indicates the subject that practices the activity. This qualitative variable can take values from 1 to 30.

- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING
